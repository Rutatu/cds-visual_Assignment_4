# Classifier benchmarks using Logistic Regression and a Neural Network

## About the script

This assignment is Class Assignment 4. The task was to create two simple command-line tools/Python scripts which can be used to perform a simple classification task on the MNIST digits data:
One script takes the full MNIST data set, trains a Logistic Regression (LR) Classifier, prints the evaluation metrics to the terminal and saves classification report and confusion matrix in a directory
Another script takes the full MNIST dataset, trains a Neural Network (NN) classifier, prints the evaluation metrics to the terminal, and saves classification report in a directory

These scripts can then be used to provide easy-to-understand benchmark scores for evaluating these models.


## Methods

The problem of the task relates to classifying digits. To address this problem, first I trained a simple LR classifier on a training set (80% of the data) and tested the performance of the classifier on a test set (20% of the data). I used the ```scikit-learn``` package for the LR classifier. For the second script, I trained a NN classifier using utility script which was developed in class (it can be found in the utils folder on github repository). Trained NN had 2 hidden layers out of possible 3 layers. The sizes of the layers were 32 and 16 with a sigmoid activation function. The  NN was trained for 500 epochs.

## Data

The MNIST database contains small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. A training set contains 60,000 examples, and a test set 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

The data was loaded using command ```fetch_openml```. The dataset name is  mnist_784, and version=1.

## Intructions to run the codes

Both codes were tested on an HP computer with Windows 10 operating system. They were executed on Jupyter worker02.

__Steps__

Set-up:
```
#1 Open terminal on worker02 or locally
#2 Navigate to the environment where you want to clone this repository
#3 Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Rutatu/cds-visual_Assignment_4.git 

#4 Navigate to the newly cloned repo
$ cd cds-visual_Assignment_4

#5 Create virtual environment with its dependencies and activate it
$ bash create_classification_venv.sh
$ source ./classification/bin/activate

``` 

Run the code:

```
#6 Navigate to the directory of the script
$ cd src

#7 Run each code with default parameters
$ python Logistic_Regression.py
$ python Neural_Network.py

#8 Run each code with self-chosen parameters
$ python Logistic_Regression.py -trs 0.9 -tes 0.1 -n lr_cm
$ python Neural_Network.py -trs 0.7 -tes 0.3 -hl1 30 -hl2 15 -hl3 5 -ep 500 -n classification_report

#9 Run the NN script only with hidden_layer_1:
$ python Neural_Network.py -hl1 30 -hl2 0

#10 To remove the newly created virtual environment
$ bash kill_classification_venv.sh

#11 To find out possible optional arguments for both scripts
$ python Logistic_Regression.py --help
$ python Neural_Network.py --help


 ```

I hope it worked!


## Results

LR classifier achieved a weighted average accuracy of 92% for correctly classifying digits. Digits 3, 5 and 8 were the most challenging to classify. The NN classifier achieved a weighted average accuracy of 96%, which is a slight improvement from LR classifier.
